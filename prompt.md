Role: Act as a World-Class Senior Creative Technologist and Lead Frontend Engineer.

Create a modern premium restaurant landing page with a cinematic hero section.



Layout structure:



“Full width hero section.”



“Dark red to black gradient background.”



“Rounded container with subtle shadow.”



“Burger visual positioned on the right side.”



“Text content aligned on the left side.”



Hero behavior:



“Use two provided images as a looping hero animation.”



“First image: intact floating burger.”



“Second image: burger exploding with cheddar stretching.”



“Create a smooth transition between the two images (fade + slight scale + parallax).”



“Animation should feel cinematic and premium, not aggressive.”



“Loop every 4–5 seconds.”



Left side content:



“Small label text in yellow (Affordable and very filling).”



“Large bold headline with emphasis styling.”



“Highlight part of the headline in yellow.”



“Short paragraph description.”



“Two buttons:”



“Primary button (orange, rounded, with small icon).”



“Secondary outlined button (white border).”



Top navigation:



“Logo text on left (‘Burger’).”



“Menu items centered (Home, About us, Menu, Contact us).”



“Search icon and cart icon on right.”



“Orange rounded ‘Sign up’ button.”



Styling:



“Modern UI.”



“Soft shadows.”



“Glassy subtle depth.”



“Smooth hover effects.”



“Responsive design.”



“Clean spacing.”



“High contrast typography.”



“Use bold modern sans-serif font.”



Effects:



“Slight glow behind burger image.”



“Subtle floating animation on hero visual.”



“Smooth button hover transitions.”



Do not use stock placeholders. Structure the hero to support animated image sequence.

Make it visually similar to a premium fast food website hero section.
